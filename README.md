# Loan Data Analysis
Description

For a safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.


Objective: Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data

Domain: Finance

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model
